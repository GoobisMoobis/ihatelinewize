# Temporary Managed Extension Bypass

## Quote from the creator:

"works on Chromebook, been doing this forever. suprised i havent seen it on here yet. "

## Note From GoobisMoobis

These steps were originally intended to be used with the GoGuardian extension. This might work to disable other managed extensions, however I have not tested it.

For thinks like step 6 that say "goguardian" I assume it works for any other extension?

I also don't know if you can do more than 1 extension at once.

If you figure this out, please either tell me in person or comment [here.](https://github.com/GoobisMoobis/ihatelinewize/issues)

## Steps:
- Step 1. Restart chromebook
- Step 2. Turn off wifi 
- Step 3. Sign back into your chromebook by logging in with existing user. Do not turn wifi back on once signed back in. 
- Step 4. Open any web browser, and go to any blocked website like crazygames. Remember to keep wifi off. 
- Step 5. Highlight the url thing, like on the searchbar. 
- Step 6. Click the goguardian symbol on the top right of your screen for 22 seconds as fast as you can 
- Step 7. Turn wifi back on. 

Now you should be able to get into any website, tab limits will be gone, and they cannot monitor your screen **until someone restarts your chromebook.** Have fun!
