# Corkey Exploit
**Interrupts the process of downloading extensions, meaning things like LineWize and GoGuardian won't install**
## Disclaimer: May get your Chromebook flagged for not having extensions
### Steps:
1. Enter recovery mode (esc+reload+power)
2. Enable Dev Mode (may be blocked sadly)
2a. Navigate to Advanced Options and select "Enable Developer Mode"
**If you can't enter dev mode this entire process will not work**
3. Bypass "safe mode"
3a. After enabling dev mode and letting the device restart, make sure to **agree/proceed** if the device prompts you to return to safemode
4. Complete the setup process, allowing your computer to do what it needs
5. Prepare to login and be ready to disconnect from internet quickly
6. Login and wait 2 seconds before disabling internet. **Check if LineWize/GoGuardian has already auto-installed. If it did, restart this method from step 1.**
7. Quickly toggle internet on and off several times to prevent LineWize from automatically reinstalling. Repeat as needed and close/reopen your Chromebook. (you will have to play around with this step, so get creative.)
8. Keep internet off unless actively browsing as if it's on too long the extensions could auto-install. **If you completed step 7 absolutely perfectly with no errors, ignore this step. Please keep in mind you might *think* you did it perfectly, even if you didn't.**
9. Enjoy!
